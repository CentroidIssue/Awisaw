### Requirements
NodeJS 6.14.11 or upper

## 4. Usage
The default Vite module runs on port 5173, but I have configured so it runs on port 1234. 

To run the code on localhost
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

If you see
```
VITE v5.0.12  ready in 195 ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:1234/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```
That means you're correct
